I decided to study alone, on weekends, the only free time I had. I had started an online course, but soon I realized that I should know the basics of programming first. I was stuck at the beginning of this course and gave up. Nonetheless, the idea of acquiring skills in such a tool that could improve data manipulation and analysis never left my mind.</p><h2 id=the-successful-attempt>The successful attempt</h2><p>As an alternative to these pandemic times - when I realized that all my plans were frozen - I decided to make this happen: learn a programming language. This time, I chose to learn Python<sup>2</sup>, which has an easy-to-understand syntax. In addition to the potential to be a tool in my work of analyzing financial data, forecasting, and creating growth strategies, learning Python also serves a general purpose that would broaden my field of knowledge.</p><p>I completed an online course of the University of Michigan and since then have been studying by my own, relying on different resources, such as books and Python library, coding solving challenges, and being mentored by my husband, who is a Pythonist with over 20 years of experience.</p><br><br><p><small><sup>1</sup> <a href=https://www.r-project.org/>R</a> is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h></span></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/volunteer_hackillinois/><span class=button__text>Volunteered for a 36-hour hackathon</span>
