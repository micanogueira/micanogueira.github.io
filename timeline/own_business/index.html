We provided an on-demand service of selected and highly qualified teams of promoters focused on the promotion of brands, products, services, campaigns and sales.</p><h2 id=an-idea-was-born>An idea was born</h2><p>I identified a pain point in the operation of promotional marketing companies as a market opportunity while freelancing for them. I participated in all stages of the operation in two or three companies and realized that they could all do better. So, I decided to solve this pain point by creating a solution that was a scalable business. As this market was not my area of expertise, I invited a friend to fill this gap and be my business partner.</p><h2 id=market-introduction>Market introduction</h2><p>After creating and validating the business model as scalable and profitable, we started to run the business by presenting a highly qualified team to the market to promote their brand, with a high standard of performance guaranteed. We created a platform for registering and managing promoters that gained popularity in a few weeks. Our competitive edge and the pain point solution was: in every promotional marketing activity, we nominated a supervisor to ensure that the team made an excellent delivery based on the high-quality training we set. It did not represent extra costs for the customer.</p><p>It worked well. The market started to notice us and spread the happy word. As a result, we got most of our clients by word-of-mouth recommendations.</p><h2 id=the-end>The end</h2><p>Without an office, this bootstrapping business ran for four years until its closure, which was done by mutual decision. While running it, I was building my career in the financial field. Consequently, my dedication and focus were most directed to Finance. In 2016, I faced the prioritization process that led me to decide to close <em>Quatrenhum</em>.</p></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h></span></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/manager_first/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
