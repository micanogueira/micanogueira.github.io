<p>Studying abroad has been a dream for over a decade! When I finally had the opportunity to live overseas, I set that as my main goal. While still in Brazil, I found TUM<sup>1</sup>, the Technical University of Munich, as the place where I wanted to study and build my academic life abroad. Getting admitted after an extensive application process was literally a dream come true!</p>
<p>By the way, this website is an outcome of my application for enrollment in the Bachelor in Management &amp; Technology<sup>2</sup> program, as a portfolio and a creative way to show an extension of my technical skills related to Computer Engineering, the field of specialization in technology that I chose in this program.</p>
<h2 id="the-perfect-fit">The perfect fit</h2>
<p>I have found the Bachelor in Management &amp; Technology program to be the perfect fit for my career and my ambition to study at TUM.</p>
<p>For about 6 years, I have developed and honed my management skills. On the other hand, I have never properly studied technology, although I have some skills. I can say that programming is a latent aptitude. When I was between 13 and 14 years old, I really wanted to study Computer Engineering. Throughout my career, I worked alongside the IT team several times, and the most I did was design mock-ups of tools and features. I have always been close enough to learning to code. In fact, I always wanted to know how to code to be independent, build my own tools and features, and meet my needs more quickly and autonomously.</p>
<p>Combining management and technology in a bachelor’s degree is combining the best of me! That is exactly the balance I have been looking for.</p>

<p>I love that feeling of starting something new at the beginning of the year, even if it means restarting something!</p>
<p>In January 2020, I started a German course at a language school<sup>1</sup> and completed the A1 module in about 2 months of intensive classes. However, it had to be stopped due to COVID-19 restrictions. In mid-May, I resumed the learning process using an online platform from an excellent German school<sup>2</sup>. After a  few months, I realized that it was not really working. I was progressing very well, passing the exercises without any problem, but I did not feel that the knowledge was taking root. I gave it some time, but that feeling remained. So I contacted a German teacher and arranged the beginning of private lessons in January 2021.</p>
<p>The lessons ran effectively until the end of September, when I reached the B1 level and started a bachelor’s degree at the Technical University of Munich. While at University, I kept up my German language learning during my first term.</p>

<p>In mid-2015, I was very committed to learning a certain programming language, R<sup>1</sup>, due to my interest in furthering the studies in the statistics that I was studying on my MBA in finance. I decided to study alone, on weekends, the only free time I had. I had started an online course, but soon I realized that I should know the basics of programming first. I was stuck at the beginning of this course and gave up. Nonetheless, the idea of acquiring skills in such a tool that could improve data manipulation and analysis never left my mind.</p>
<h2 id="the-successful-attempt">The successful attempt</h2>
<p>As an alternative to the quarantine times due to COVID-19 – when I realized that all my plans were frozen – I decided to make this happen: learn a programming language. This time, I chose to learn Python<sup>2</sup> which has an easy-to-understand syntax. In addition to the potential to be a tool in my work of analyzing financial data, forecasting, and creating growth strategies, learning Python also serves a general purpose that would broaden my field of knowledge.</p>
<p>I completed an online course at the University of Michigan and since then have been studying on my own, relying on different resources, such as books and the Python documentation, solving coding challenges, and being mentored by my husband, who is a Pythonista with over 20 years of experience.</p>

<h2 id="the-opportunity">The opportunity</h2>
<p>This opportunity came across because my husband is one of the mentors. He has been mentoring HackIllinois for four consecutive years. For his third time, we travelled together and contributed in different ways to this amazing event.</p>

<h2 id="oops-its-2020">Oops, it&rsquo;s 2020</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, these pandemic times kept me away from classes. I considered going back to school many times, but it was not the safest method at the time, although it is the most efficient in my point of view.</p>
<p>The alternative was to start an online German course at Goethe<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>I completed the English course in Brazil a month before moving to Europe. I believed that I was ready to travel abroad and communicate fluently. However, it was a shock when I moved and realized that I could barely understand what people were saying. The different accents sounded like another language to me. It took me about 2 months to train my ears and get used to it. I tried to learn German and improve my English at the same time, but it didn&rsquo;t work. At least, it worked to show me that I needed to focus on one language at a time. So I chose to focus on improving my English, finishing what I had already started.</p>
<p>I participated in language exchange meetups, started to study individually at home, and met a person who agreed to do a tandem. These efforts have really improved my English skills, except for one and fundamental thing: confidence. When I realized that I was afraid to open my mouth and make mistakes all the time, I decided to take the next step: go to a country that has English as its mother tongue.</p>
<h2 id="full-immersion">Full immersion</h2>
<p>I went to London to study at an English School<sup>1</sup>. I took a preparation course to obtain the international certification, IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and took extra special classes &ldquo;Speaking with Confidence&rdquo;. It was an intensive course of 22.5 hours per week for 2 months (8 weeks). In addition, I chose to live with a family in the first month and with a different family in the second month, in order to expand my experience and have a complete immersion.</p>
<p>Going to London was a milestone in my learning process. I improved in two months what I couldn&rsquo;t do before. More than advancing to level C1 on the school exit test and achieving the minimum IELTS required for a master&rsquo;s degree in Europe, I gained the confidence I was looking for and returned to Munich ready to learn the next language: German.</p>

As I was about to travel to Brazil on vacation in a few weeks, I arranged to meet them in person and learn more about their project. We had some meetings during my stay in Brazil, I met their partners and started to mentor them. I returned to Munich and continued this mentorship for a few months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, other people have reached me, which made me decide to be an empowering agent of entrepreneurship, voluntarily and remotely guiding startups and small businesses in Brazil, fostering their strategies in different areas, from business plans to marketing.</p>

We got married in Brazil on April 14, 2018, according to our original schedule, and flew to Munich, Germany, four days after the wedding, arriving there on April 19, 2018.</p>

<p>The next edition of the program took place in the same year and gained a different format and new sponsors. I participated in giving support in all possible topics, such as market introduction and strategic planning.</p>
<p>At that time, other acceleration programs invited me to give talks at events that they organized to promote innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>In Latin America, Brazilians are the only ones who speak Portuguese. Even though we are surrounded by countries that have Spanish as their mother tongue, we do not have a second official language. It may be the reason why there&rsquo;s no incentive to learn another language. In the second part of elementary education in public schools, English is mandatory, but it does not go beyond the basics. Unfortunately, taking an English course privately is something that does not fit the budget of most Brazilians.</p>
<h2 id="my-turn-has-come">My turn has come</h2>
<p>I only had the chance to study English at a specialized school<sup>1</sup> at the age of 26, at the end of 2016. Before, all the knowledge of English that I had was acquired in a self-taught way, with resources that were tangible to me, such as music and readings. I also learned a lot at my first job, in 2005, when I worked at a translation company. Grasping every opportunity on my path took me to the intermediate level, but it wasn’t good enough to give me confidence when speaking.</p>
<p>I completed the course in 18 months, moving from intermediate to advanced level.</p>

<p>Even amid a swirl of things to manage in my <a href="https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/startup_sympla/">current job</a>, getting an MBA in Finance represented an appropriate personal decision.

<h2 id="the-youngest-student">The youngest student</h2>
<p>I started an MBA in Finance at IBMEC (Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets)<sup>1</sup>, a reference school in finance and business in the country. After passing the selection process, I became the youngest student in my class.

<p>This experience gave me an incredible opportunity to make a difference! I was the Financial Manager and Team Leader of a successful startup, Sympla<sup>1</sup>, an online platform for sale and management of tickets and registration for events. I worked there for four years, since the embryonic stage.</p>
<p>The first time I met Rodrigo Cartacho, the CEO, was special. It was on this memorable occasion that I, full of enthusiasm, decided to dive right into the challenge of starting four departments from scratch. Rodrigo conducted one of the stages of the interview process, which took place on the balcony because, at that time, there was no meeting room. This small and simple detail became a milestone, as it represents how long the travelled road was when the starting point for me was a room with a meeting room under construction and four newly hired employees – the very first ones – and the destination was almost the entire building occupied and more than 200 employees working on. More than that, we have transformed a start-up into the company with the largest number of events for sale in Brazil. It meant a lot of work and concerted effort by the entire team, and pride and joy, consequently.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-bring-them-on">Challenges? Bring them on!</h2>
<p>During the first year, I led and structured the financial, administrative, human resources and personnel departments. The second year was a moment of transition in which I had to hand over control of the various cards I was holding in a scenario of significant company growth where I had only one intern to support me. Therefore, I expanded my team as well as selected and hired people to run those three latter departments. Then, I finally was able to focus on the finance department, bringing even more improvements. Many projects, challenges and changes have emerged in the following two years.</p>
<h2 id="recognition">Recognition</h2>
<p>At length, when I decided to end this period of my career to take a break and follow my way living abroad, I left a company 50 times bigger than when I started, with 5 more offices in 5 different cities and nationally recognized as the market leader; two completed due diligence that resulted in two investments made by a global leader in mobile marketplaces; a management software (SAP) implemented and designed to integrate all operations; innumerable procedures developed and good practices applied; and last but not least, a brilliant and loyal financial team to continue the work of ensuring the company’s financial stability and growth.</p>

<p>What was supposed to be only an audit led me to my first job as a financial manager. I was approached by one of the partners to do an independent audit of their company<sup>1</sup>, including assets and debts since its inception. Within a month, the CEO asked for a blueprint of what would be an ideal finance department.</p>
<p>In addition to the audit, I built the finance department, its processes and routine from scratch; created the job description, selected and hired a person to do the basics tasks – an assistant – and get the department started. At the end of the audit and consultancy, the CEO, who longed for a more organized company, with well-defined planning and procedures, invited me to work alongside him to restructure it. So, I assumed the role of Manager of the finance, administrative and human resources departments.</p>
<h2 id="management-phase">Management phase</h2>
<p>Changes such as policies, controls, and processes implementation caused tough resistance from employees. However, as tough as this resistance were my patience and persistence in being transparent and presenting each change clearly, explaining what/why/how/when it should be applied. In a few weeks, I gained their trust and, more than that, their support. I considered it as a triumph during my first time managing a team. In this case, a multidisciplinary team of 8 people.</p>
<p>Besides the restructuring project, I designed and implemented the operating flow of the new revenue stream, starting another department from scratch: a sales one. Once again, I built and implemented procedures, controls, and routines, as well as hiring the team and organizing their training. The sales surpassed expectations, representing about 80% of all revenue in less than a year.</p>

<p><em>Quatrenhum</em> was a small business directed by myself and a partner. We provided an on-demand service of selected and highly qualified teams of promoters focused on the promotion of brands, products, services, campaigns and sales.</p>
<h2 id="an-idea-was-born">An idea was born</h2>
<p>I identified a pain point in the operation of promotional marketing companies as a market opportunity while freelancing for them. I participated in all stages of the operation in two or three companies and realized that they could all do better. So, I decided to solve this pain point by creating a solution that was a scalable business. As this market was not my area of expertise, I invited a friend to fill this gap and be my business partner.</p>
<h2 id="market-introduction">Market introduction</h2>
<p>After creating and validating the business model as scalable and profitable, we started to run the business by presenting a highly qualified team to the market to promote their brand, with a high standard of performance guaranteed. We created a platform for registering and managing promoters that gained popularity in a few weeks. Our competitive edge and the pain point solution was: in every promotional marketing activity, we nominated a supervisor to ensure that the team made an excellent delivery based on the high-quality training we set. It did not represent extra costs for the customer.</p>
<p>It worked well. The market started to notice us and spread the happy word. As a result, we got most of our clients by word-of-mouth recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>
<p>Without an office, this bootstrapping business ran for four years until its closure, which was done by mutual decision. While running it, I was building my career in the financial field. Consequently, my dedication and focus were most directed to Finance. In 2016, I faced the prioritization process that led me to decide to close <em>Quatrenhum</em>.</p>

<h2 id="first-projects">First projects</h2>
<p>I spent two months delved into my first consultancy as an independent professional. The owners of an engineering company had an important decision to make, which could culminate in its voluntary dissolution. Knowing the current financial situation would be crucial in this process. An audit of accounts and an examination of tax, financial and accounting documents were the essential starting point. As a result, I presented a final financial report showing how the company was being managed, the composition of its costs, debts and forecasts.</p>
<p>In late 2011, another project emerged, in which the consultancy was focused on improving its financial management and inventory control processes.</p>

In that fraction of time, I just took a deep breath and remembered how much I dedicated myself to be the first person in my family to graduate from a University; how hard I worked to be there; how many nights studying to recover the time that I spent in an office, working, while other students could only focus on studying; how proud I was of myself&hellip; and then, my name was called!

In addition, I supported the industrial production team in the management of materials logistics and optimization of the production process through the PPC (Production Planning and Control) methodology, for which I received adequate training to develop the necessary skills.</p>

<p>A professor specialized in finance became my supervisor to guide me in my main task of advising solidarity economy ventures.</p>
<h2 id="university-incubator-project">University Incubator Project</h2>
<p>The University Incubator Project was a cooperative venture for processing natural food into dehydrated food. In 2005, an agreement was signed between the Government, the mayor’s office and the University for the development of this solidarity economy pilot project. I joined the team in 2009, when the physical facilities were completed, to meet the lack of operational procedures and promote governance practices.</p>
<p>I worked with groups of housewives, unemployed women and beneficiaries of a Federal Government Program. They formed this cooperative venture as associates. As the main objective of the project was administrative emancipation, they were learning to be owners of their own business through the solidarity economy methodology. I acted as a facilitating agent between these associates and some institutions when dealing with bureaucracy. Moreover, I applied my knowledge in finance to support them in managing the business, advising and giving a full consultancy.</p>
<h2 id="solidarity-economy">Solidarity Economy</h2>
<p>The crisis of capitalism and its inherent worsening of poverty has led to the emergence of different modes of production. One is the solidarity economy that emerged to serve the population excluded from the formal labour market. Thus, people from a local community such as artisans, for example, come together and work collectively and associatively, using solidarity principles in which one collaborates with the other. Equitable income distribution eliminates labour exploitation. Relations with other partners are also based on a solidarity economy, which makes trade fair.</p>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>The work of fostering financial education in the incubator was so successful that I travelled to the countryside as a representative of the Dean of Extension to give talks to local producers and small cooperatives. These talks were open to discussion in order to address the participants&rsquo; issues and develop consultancy for building a solidarity venture.</li>
<li>I researched the solidarity economy during the period in which I worked in the incubator and continued researching after the internship ended. I used this experience to write my thesis, which aimed to show that a solidarity enterprise can be economically and financially viable.</li>
<li>Working in the extension programs department led me to be even more active as a volunteer, especially in social projects. The one that I dedicated the most was the <a href="https://www.gov.br/defesa/pt-br/assuntos/projeto-rondon">Rondon Project</a>, the largest university volunteer initiative in Brazil.</li>

<h2 id="the-extension-program">The extension program</h2>
<p>The initial kick-off of the project was to develop its theoretical framework; in other words, to develop the methodology and research to show the team and other partners what methods would be used. The next step was to compose the team. So the teacher and I selected the other volunteers. In this first stage of the project, we conducted focus group interviews with teachers from different programs to diagnose what the main problems were in the social relations between employees, teachers and students. We also conducted these focus group interviews with students, also from different programs.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, I presented the project and its current results at the Extension Workshop at the University.</p>

Apart from the teamwork, I was also responsible for data tabulation.</p>
<p>At the end of our work, we were able to make a diagnosis, identify the community&rsquo;s demand and propose actions through new extension programs.</p>

<h2 id="managing-expectations">Managing expectations</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of my second year of high school, while working in a bank in parallel, my dream was to study economics. I aimed at the Federal University, which offered a recognizable program in economics. This dream lasted the two years I had to finish high school. During a vocational test and visit to the Federal University, I discovered that the classes would be in the morning and afternoon. This important information shattered my dream because working was a matter of necessity for me. I had to work to study, to pay for basic expenses such as academic books, transportation and food. I couldn’t afford to study on a shift other than at night.</p>
<p>In summary, I had to be realistic and find a program related to economics, where classes were taught on the night shift. Besides, developing skills that helped me find a balance between work and study remained my number one day-to-day task.</p>

<p>My main task was to open bank accounts. In a few months, I managed to retain some customers, which broadened my customer service, allowing me to do more than the basics, such as selling financial products. With the knowledge and practice acquired, I took part in the onboarding and training processes of new employees, leading them during the first weeks of working directly with the client.</p>

<p>It all started when I heard the news that some private schools in my hometown were offering scholarships to high school students who couldn’t afford it. That caught my attention immediately. Admission to universities in Brazil requires students to sit a very competitive entrance exam known as <em>vestibular</em>. Private high school students have a great advantage due to the high-quality education they receive. Besides, they can afford extra classes or preparatory courses for the entrance exam. At that time, all my studies had been completed in public school. Furthermore, financing a preparatory course was out of the question. The news really put me back on track to pursue higher education.</p>
<h2 id="pinning-all-my-hopes">Pinning all my hopes</h2>
<p>Ambitiously, I aimed my efforts at the best private high school<sup>1</sup> in the city. It held first place in the college admissions ranking for consecutive years.</p>
<p>After a social-economic interview, I was able to take the scholarship test. I was very confident on the day of the exam, but I must confess that when I saw hundreds of students in the gymnasium, my legs trembled. During the test, my pencil broke and I lost my eraser, which made me quite nervous. However, I returned home with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h2 id="i-did-it">I did it</h2>
<p>Weeks later, I was about to turn off my computer at my workstation when I decided to look up my name on the approved list. I remember this moment so vividly! When I scrolled a bit and found my name, I could barely believe it. I wanted to shout of joy, but I couldn’t because I was in the office. I felt so proud of myself. I was one of the twelve students who passed among the more than five hundred candidates.</p>
<p>I grasped an opportunity to study for two years at the best private school in the city as a way to prepare for the <em>vestibular</em>, increasing my chances of competing for a place in college.</p>

<p>Within a few months, I was using the acquired abilities to help him in his ambitious project, AVRO dx, an unabridged online English-Portuguese-English Dictionary.

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
