I believed that I was ready to travel abroad and communicate fluently. However, it was a shock when I moved and realized that I could barely understand what people were saying. The different accents sounded like another language to me. It took me about 2 months to train my ears and get used to it. I tried to learn German and improve my English at the same time, but it didn&rsquo;t work. At least, it worked to show me that I needed to focus on one language at a time. So I chose to focus on improving my English, finishing what I had already started.</p><p>I participated in language exchange meetups, started to study individually at home, and met a person who agreed to do a tandem. These efforts have really improved my English skills, except for one and fundamental thing: confidence. When I realized that I was afraid to open my mouth and make mistakes all the time, I decided to take the next step: go to a country that has English as its mother tongue.</p><h2 id=full-immersion>Full immersion</h2><p>I went to London to study at an English School<sup>1</sup>. I took a preparation course to obtain the international certification, IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and took extra special classes &ldquo;Speaking with Confidence&rdquo;. It was an intensive course of 22.5 hours per week for 2 months (8 weeks). In addition, I chose to live with a family in the first month and with a different family in the second month, in order to expand my experience and have a complete immersion.</p><p>Going to London was a milestone in my learning process. I improved in two months what I couldn&rsquo;t do before. More than advancing to level C1 on the school exit test and achieving the minimum IELTS required for a master&rsquo;s degree in Europe, I gained the confidence I was looking for and returned to Munich ready to learn the next language: German.</p><br><br><p><small><sup>1</sup> <a href=http://www.ecenglish.com/>EC English</a> is a language centre with 25 schools around the world that offers academic, business and general English courses.</small></p></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h></span></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_german/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
