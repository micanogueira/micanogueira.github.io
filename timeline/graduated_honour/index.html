My friends were already staring at me, and my family was saying my name a few seconds before the professor named it. In that fraction of time, I just took a deep breath and remembered how much I dedicated myself to be the first person in my family to graduate from a University; how hard I worked to be there; how many nights studying to recover the time that I spent in an office, working, while other students could only focus on studying; how proud I was of myself&mldr; and then, my name was called! Applause and shouting were the soundtracks that pushed me to the stage to be honoured. In that night, I was awarded a Golden Medal of Honour for outstanding performance throughout the Financial Management program at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.<sup>1</sup></p><br><br><p><small><sup>1</sup> <a href=https://www.pucminas.br/destaques/Paginas/default.aspx>Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais</a> (PUC Minas) is a private and non-profit Brazilian Catholic university.
