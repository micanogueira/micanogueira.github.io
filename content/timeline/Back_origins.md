## *"The good son always returns home"*

I was invited to work again (once in 2006) on the company's<sup>1</sup> main project, AVRO dx, an unabridged online English-Portuguese-English Dictionary. This time, temporarily, reviewing the formatting and testing the platform as an end-user. Besides, I supported the administrative team with a focus on financial routine and customer service.

Being a QA tester came very naturally to me, although I had never played that role before. Working with the IT team, I contributed to the platform usage by reporting issues and requesting features, which turned into great improvements. Consequently, an open communication channel emerged between IT and other co-workers who also wanted to contribute.
