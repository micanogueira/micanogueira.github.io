## From the classes to the office: pratical application

Since I became the teaching assistant of the Financial Mathematics discipline of the Financial Management course, I wanted to bring vivid experience to class. Therefore, I also became an intern at an engineering company. My interest in learning to apply those maths in a real environment drove me to assume so many responsibilities that I ended up replacing my supervisor for a month. For the first time, I could operate the entire financial routine of a company, including cash flow control and bank negotiations.
