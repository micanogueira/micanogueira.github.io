## Engagement

As soon as my second year of college<sup>1</sup> started, I tried to remain engaged in extracurricular activities. I was invited by the same professor with whom I worked in the previous extension program to be the coordinator of a new extension program he had submitted to the University.  I volunteered to lead the "Student - University - Society Integration Program" project, which aimed to promote education and strength the mission of the University, providing training to students and promoting their integration to teachers, employees, colleagues, community, and the teaching, research and extension system.

## The extension program

The kick-off of the project was to develop its theoretical framework; in other words, to develop the methodology and research to show the team and other partners which methods would be used. The next step was to compose this team. So the teacher and I selected and hired the other volunteers. In this first stage of the project, we conducted interviews in focus groups with teachers from diverse courses to diagnose what are the main problems in the social relationships between employees, teachers and students. We also conducted these interviews in focus groups with students, also from diverse courses.

At the end of the semester, I presented the project and its current results at the Extension Workshop at the University.
