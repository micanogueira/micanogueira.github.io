I set high expectations for my first job after college, which I agreed to start from scratch in an unusual program that assigned me to do very simple tasks as a way to have me in all sub-departments of the finance department. That way, I would know all processes, their strengths and weaknesses, which would make me able to achieve a leadership position. However, in parallel, I started to give consultancy to friends' businesses. Thinking outside the box led me to draft my own business.
