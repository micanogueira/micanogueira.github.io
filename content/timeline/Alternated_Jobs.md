## Spinning plates

I set high expectations for my first job after college, which I agreed to start from scratch on an unusual program at a car dealership<sup>1</sup>. This program assigned me to do elementary tasks as a way to acquaint myself with all subdivisions in the finance department. That way, I would know all the processes, their strengths and weaknesses, which would enable me to reach a leadership position in a short period of time.

Alternately, I was working as an independent consultant, including advising friends' businesses. Thinking outside the box led me to draft my own business.
