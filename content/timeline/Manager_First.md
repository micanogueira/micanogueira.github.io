What was supposed to be only an audit led me to my first job as a financial manager. I was approached by one of the partners to do an independent audit of the company, including assets and debts since its inception. Within a month, the CEO asked for a blueprint of what would be an ideal finance department.

In addition to the audit, I built the finance department, its processes and routine from scratch; created the job description, selected and hired a person to do the basics tasks – an assistant – and get the department started. At the end of the audit and consultancy, the CEO, who longed for a more organized company, with well-defined planning and procedures, invited me to work alongside him to restructure it. So, I assumed the finance department, as well as the administrative and human resources department.

Changes such as policies, controls, and process implementation caused a tough resistance from employees. However, as tough as this resistance was my patience and persistence in being transparent and presenting each change clearly, explaining what/why/how/when it should be applied. In a few weeks, I gained their trust and, more than that, their support. I considered it has a thriumph during my fist time managing a team. In this case, a multidisciplinary team of 8 people.

Besides the restructuring project, I designed and implemented the operating flow of the new revenue stream, starting another department from scratch: a sales one. Once again, I built and implemented procedures, controls, and routines, as well as hiring the team and organizing their training. The sales surpassed expectations, representing about 80% of all revenue in less than a year.
