## It started before it even started

When I was fifteen years old, in late 2005, I came across an offer to learn to type. Simple like that but at that time I did not have a computer and I was eager to study it, starting with the basics. Then, the founder of AVRO and also a familyâ€™s friend offered to teach it to me for an hour a day.

Within a few months, I was using the abilities acquired to help him in his ambitious project: AVRO dx, a complete online English-Portuguese-English Dictionary. I was informally organizing and formating a copy of the database, as a way to practice typing. When I realized, I was also reporting some errors and doing this job so quickly that he invited me to officially contribute to the project and work in the company as an assistant in administrative routines.

## Lessons learned

During a year I learned more than informatics, I also learned how a company runs, what are its duties and responsibilities, how I should behave in a professional environment, and how to find a balance between studies and job. It gave me fuel to take the next steps: quitting my first job, finding an internship, and winning a scholarship at one of the best private high schools in my hometown.
