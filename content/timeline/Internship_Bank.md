## Inspiration moves us brightly!

I met Andrea for the first time in my interview, when she pointed to the desk and said: “You will work there if you pass this process”. I left the interview with a genuine smile on my face. I felt with all my heart that this internship vacancy would be mine. This is the most vivid and shiny memory I have of this experience.

Andrea was my supervisor and also the manager of the sector where I worked at the bank. More than that, she was my first female reference and inspiration for leadership. I admired so much the way she treated people equally, clients and coworkers, at any level, that I decided to follow her. My main task was to open bank accounts. In a few months, I managed to retain some customers, which broadened my customer service, allowing me to do more than the basics, such as selling financial products. With the knowledge and practice acquired, I took part in the onboarding and training processes of new employees, leading them during the first weeks of working directly with the client.

This experience led me to define my career: studying financial management at one of the best private colleges in the country, by means of a scholarship.
