## New year, new beginnings

I love that feeling of starting something new at the beginning of the year, even if it means restarting something!

In January 2020, I started a German course at a language school<sup>1</sup> and completed the A1 module in about 2 months of intensive classes. However, it had to be stopped due to COVID-19 restrictions. In mid-May, I resumed the learning process using an online platform from an excellent German school<sup>2</sup>. After a  few months, I realized that it was not really working. I was progressing very well, passing the exercises without any problem, but I did not feel that the knowledge was taking root. I gave it some time, but that feeling remained. So I contacted a German teacher and arranged the beginning of private lessons in January 2021.

Since then, I have improved a lot, especially in speaking. Each day is a challenge, as expected, but it is working quite well and I'm enjoying it. I'm currently in a transition phase from A2 to B1.
