## New semester, more knowledge to share

I found great joy in teaching other classes and showing them different ways to learn and improve their skills. For that reason, at the beginning of my second year of college<sup>1</sup>, I decided to keep being a teaching assistant but in a new discipline. Therefore, I became the teaching assistant of the Financial Mathematics discipline of the Financial Management course.
