## From the gound up

This experience gave me an incredible opportunity to make a difference! I was the Financial Manager and Team Leader of a successful startup, [Sympla](https://www.sympla.com.br), an online platform for sale and management of tickets and registration for events. I worked there for four years, since the embryonic stage.

The first time I met Rodrigo Cartacho, the CEO, was special. It was on this memorable occasion that I, full of enthusiasm, decided to dive right in the challenge of starting four departments from scratch. Rodrigo conducted one of the stages of the interview process, which took place on the balcony because, at that time, there was no meeting room. This small and simple detail became a milestone, as it represents how long the travelled road was, when the starting point for me was a room with a meeting room under construction and four newly hired employees – the very frist ones – and the destination was almost the entire building occupied and more than 200 employees working on. More than that, we have transformed a start-up into the company with the largest number of events for sale in Brazil. It meant a lot of work and concerted effort by the entire team, and pride and joy, consequently.

## Challenges? Bring them on!

During the first year, I led and structured the financial, administrative, human resources and personnel departments. Simultaneously, I found another project to start, which was the MBA in Finance. Even amid a swirl of things to manage, it was an appropriate personal decision. As I strongly believed in the rapid growth of the company, I also believed that I should be prepared to manage that. The second year was a moment of transition in which I had to hand over control of the various cards I was holding in a scenario of significant company growth and having only one intern supporting me. So I expanded my team as well as I selected and hired people to run those three latter departments. Then, I finally was able to focus on the finance department, bringing even more improvements. Many projects, challenges and changes have emerged in the following two years.

## Recognition

At length, when I decided to end this period on my career to take a break and follow my way living abroad, I left a company 50 times bigger than when I started, with 5 more offices in 5 different cities and nationally recognized as a market leader; two completed due diligences that resulted in two investments made by a global leader in mobile marketplaces; a management software (SAP) implemented and designed to integrate all operations; innumerable procedures developed and good practices applied; and last but not least, a brilliant and loyal financial team to continue the work of ensuring the company’s financial stability and growth.
