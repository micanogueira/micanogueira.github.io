## The passion

In fact, that passion has always been there, hidden in my guts. When I was only six to seven years old, in my first year of school, I had my first experience teaching. I supported the teacher by helping my colleagues learn to read. I was timid at that time, but sitting next to someone else and teaching reading and writing was very natural. In the following years of elementary school, I created lessons and printed them out for the class to do as homework. It was like I was a young teaching assistant.

## Becoming a Teaching Assistant

Students with high marks in a given discipline can apply to be a teaching assistant of that discipline. Even in the first year of college, I became one. In my second semester (in Brazil, the colleges have two terms that we call semester or period), I started teaching the Introduction to Accounting discipline in the 2/2009 class of the Financial Management course, which was in their first semester at college.
