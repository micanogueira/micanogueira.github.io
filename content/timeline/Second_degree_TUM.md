## A dream comes true

Studying abroad has been a dream for over a decade! When I finally had the opportunity to live overseas, I set that as my main goal. While still in Brazil, I found TUM<sup>1</sup>, the Technical University of Munich, as the place where I wanted to study and build my academic life abroad. Getting admitted after an extensive application process was literally a dream come true!

By the way, this website is an outcome of my application for enrollment in the Bachelor in Management & Technology<sup>2</sup> program, as a portfolio and a creative way to show an extension of my technical skills related to Computer Engineering, the field of specialization in technology that I chose in this program.

## The perfect fit

I have found the Bachelor in Management & Technology program to be the perfect fit for my career and my ambition to study at TUM.

For about 6 years, I have developed and honed my management skills. On the other hand, I have never properly studied technology, although I have some skills. I can say that programming is a latent aptitude. When I was between 13 and 14 years old, I really wanted to study Computer Engineering. Throughout my career, I worked alongside the IT team several times, and the most I did was design mock-ups of tools and features. I have always been close enough to learning to code. In fact, I always wanted to know how to code to be independent, build my own tools and features, and meet my needs more quickly and autonomously.

Combining management and technology in a bachelor’s degree is combining the best of me! That is exactly the balance I have been looking for.
