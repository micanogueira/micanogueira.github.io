## The opportune time

I had been pursuing an MBA since I was about to finish college. However, it only became possible three years later, which I can say was even better due to the professional and personal maturity that I had acquired so far.

Even amid a swirl of things to manage in my [current job](https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/startup_sympla/), getting an MBA in Finance represented an appropriate personal decision. The skills that I learned and improved perfectly fit the needs I had to fulfil in the scenario the company I was working for was in, especially during its M&A (mergers and acquisitions) processes, which was something that I was leading and doing for the very first time.

## The youngest student

I started an MBA in Finance at IBMEC (Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets)<sup>1</sup>, a reference school in finance and business in the country. After passing the selection process, I became the youngest student in my class. According to the school's coordinator, my professional experience was adequate and would be an enriching exchange of knowledge in the classroom.
