## New year, new projects

I love that feeling of starting something new at the beginning of the year. I was very excited to start learning German at a language school<sup>1</sup> at last. On January 7th, I was completely lost on my first day of school. That first week was challenging. In the next two months, I realized that I was already quite acquainted with the language and enjoying learning it.

## Oops, it's 2020

Unfortunately, these pandemic times kept me away from classes. I considered going back to school many times, but it was not the safest method at the time, although it is the most efficient in my point of view.

The alternative was to start an online German course at Goethe<sup>2</sup>.
