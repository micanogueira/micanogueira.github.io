## New year, new projects

I love that feeling of starting something new at the beginning of the year. I was very excited to start learning German at a language school<sup>1</sup> at last. On January 7th, I was completely lost on my first day of school. That first week was challenging. In the next two months, I realized that I was already quite acquainted with the language and enjoying learning it.

## Oops, it's 2020

Unfortunately, these pandemic times have kept me away from classes. I have considered going back to school many times, but it's not the safest method anymore, although it's the most efficient in my point of view.

Since May, I have been studying German online at the Goethe<sup>2</sup> website.
