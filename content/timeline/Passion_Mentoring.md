## Promoting innovation and entrepreneurship

A friend of mine who was also a former co-worker invited me to mentor in the "financial week" of a startup acceleration program<sup>1</sup>. I was very excited to have this opportunity to share knowledge and support the local startup ecosystem. As it couldn't be different, my engagement went beyond that week. I became part of the examining board, judging the various early-stage startups, their businesses and their financial projections.

The next edition of the program took place in the same year and gained a different format and new sponsors. I participated in giving support in all possible topics, such as market introduction and strategic planning. 

At that time, other acceleration programs invited me to give talks at events that they organized to promote innovation and entrepreneurship.
