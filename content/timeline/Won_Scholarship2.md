I received a high score in the national entrance exam (known as ENEM in Brazil), which made me eligible to win a scholarship to college. I was selected by the best private university<sup>1</sup> in the country and ranked third in the Financial Management course.

## Managing expectations

Since the beginning of my second year of high school, while working in a bank in parallel, my dream was to study economics. I aimed at the Federal University, which offered a recognizable course in economics. This dream lasted the two years I had to finish high school. During a vocational test and visit to the Federal University, I discovered that the classes would be in the morning and afternoon. This important information shattered my dream because working as a matter of necessity for me. I had to work to study, to pay for basic expenses such as academic books, transportation and food. I couldn’t afford to study on a different shift than at night.

In summary, I had to be realistic and find a course related to economics, where classes were taught on the night shift. Besides, developing skills that would help me find a balance between work and study would remain my number one day-to-day task.
