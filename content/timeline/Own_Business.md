## Quatrenhum Events

*Quatrenhum* was a small business directed by myself and a partner. We provided an on-demand service of selected and highly qualified teams of promoters focused on the promotion of brands, products, services, campaigns and sales.

## An idea was born

I identified a pain point in the operation of promotional marketing companies as a market opportunity while freelancing for them. I participated in all stages of the operation in two or three companies and realized that they could all do better. So, I decided to solve this pain point by creating a solution that was a scalable business. As this market was not my area of expertise, I invited a friend to fill this gap and be my business partner.

## Market introduction

After creating and validating the business model as scalable and profitable, we started to run the business by presenting a highly qualified team to the market to promote their brand, with a high standard of performance guaranteed. We created a platform for registering and managing promoters that gained popularity in a few weeks. Our competitive edge and the pain point solution was: in every promotional marketing actions, we nominated a supervisor to ensure that the team makes an excellent delivery based on the high-quality training we set. It did not represent extra costs for the customer. It worked well. The market started to notice us and spread the happy word. As a result, we got most of our clients by word of mouth recommendations.

## The end

Without an office, this bootstrapping business ran for four years until its closure, which was done by mutual decision. While running it, I was building my career in the financial field. Consequently, my dedication and focus were most directed to Finance. In 2016, I faced the prioritization process that led me to decide to close *Quatrenhum*.
