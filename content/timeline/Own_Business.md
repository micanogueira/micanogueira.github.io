## *Quatrenhum Events*

Quatrenhum was a small business directed by myself and a partner. We provided an on-demand service of selected and highly qualified teams of promoters focused on the promotion of brands, products, services, campaigns and sales.

I identified a pain point in the operation of promotional marketing companies as a market opportunity while freelancing for them. I participated in all stages of the operation in two or three companies and realized that they could all do better. So, I decided to solve this pain point by creating a solution that was a scalable business. As this market was not my area of expertise, I invited a friend to fill this gap and be my business partner.

After creating and validating the business model as scalable and profitable, we started to run the business by presenting a highly qualified team to the market to promote their brand, with a high standard of performance guaranteed. We created a platform for registering and managing promoters that gained popularity in a few weeks. But our competitive edge and the pain point solution was: in every promotional marketing actions, we nominated a supervisor to ensure that the team makes an excellent delivery based on the high-quality training we set. It did not represent extra costs for the customer. It worked well. The market started to notice us and spread the happy word. As a result, we got most of our clients by word of mouth recommendations.

Without an office, this bootstrapping business ran for four years until its closure, which was done by mutual decision. While running it, I was building my career in the Financial field. Consequently, my dedication and focus were most directed to Finance. In 2016, I faced the prioritization process that led me to decide to close Quatrenhum..
