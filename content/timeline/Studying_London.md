## English in Brazil

In Latin America, Brazilians are the only ones who speak Portuguese. Even though we are surrounded by countries that have Spanish as its mother tongue, we do not have a second official language. It may be the reason that there's no incentive to learn another language. In the second part of elementary education in public schools, English is mandatory, but it does not go beyond the basics. Taking an English course privately is something that does not fit the budget of most Brazilians. I only had the chance to study English at a specialized school at the age of 26, at the end of 2016. I moved from intermediate to advanced level in about 18 months.

## Confidence is the key

I completed the English course in Brazil a month before I moved to Europe. I believed that I was ready to travel abroad and communicate fluently. However, it was a shock when I moved. I realized that I could barely understand what people were saying. The different accents sounded like another language. It took me about 2 months to train my ears and get used to it. I tried to learn German and improve English at the same time, but it didn't work. At least, it worked to show me that I needed to focus on one language at a time. So I chose to focus on improving English.

I participated in language exchange meetups, started to study individually at home, and met a person who agreed to do a tandem. These efforts have really improved my English skills, except for one and fundamental thing: confidence. When I realized that I was afraid to open my mouth and make mistakes all the time, I decided to take the next step: go to a country that has English as its mother tongue.

## Full immersion

I went to London to study at an English School<sup>1</sup>. I took a preparation course to obtain the international certification, IELTS (International English Language Testing System) and took extra special classes "Speaking with Confidence". It was an intensive course of 22.5 hours per week for 2 months (8 weeks). In addition, I chose to live with two different families, to expand my experience and have a complete immersion.

Going to London was a milestone in my learning process. I improved in two months what I couldn't do before. More than advancing to level C1 on the school exit test and achieving the minimum IELTS required for a master's degree, I gained the confidence I was looking for and returned to Munich ready to learn the next language: German.
