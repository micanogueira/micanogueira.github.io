Going abroad was always a dream: living a completely different lifestyle, exploring new experiences, getting used to other cultures and customs, learning a foreign language... In mid-2016, I decided to include it on my wish list and add a purpose: studying abroad, which since my graduation had been a dream. I set as a goal a master's degree related to economics and consumer behaviour. I also designated a starting point, starting in 2018, after my wedding.

Nonetheless, life flows freely and we have no total control over it. At the end of 2017, a great opportunity arose just before planned: my husband received a proposal to work in a city where there was exactly the master's degree subject I was looking for. We got married in Brazil on April 14, 2018, according to our original schedule, and flew to Munich, Germany, four days after the wedding, arriving there on April 19, 2018.
