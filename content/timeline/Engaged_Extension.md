## Roots

Throughout my school life, I have been engaged in extra activities such as choir, student council, newspaper, theatre, and dancing. I used to extend my hours at school, supporting teachers and diverse staff members. I have often been a class representative. Sometimes, a commencement speaker.

When I entered college<sup>1</sup>, it was no different. In the first year, I already found myself involved in an extra activity: extension programs. I volunteered to support the "Census and Citizenship" project, which aimed to diagnose the community's socio-economic situation in order to highlight and prioritize needs.

## The extension program

A multidisciplinary team composed of three different courses was organized to work together to achieve the objective. We interviewed people who lived near the campus. My group and I focused on interviewing people who lived in a building complex nearby. We collected information about basic needs, such as eating habits, health, education, social, and leisure. Apart from the teamwork, I was also responsible for data tabulation. At the end of our work, we were able to make a diagnosis, identify the community's demand and propose actions through new extension programs.
