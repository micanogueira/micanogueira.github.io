## Laying the groundwork

My experience as a financial advisor in 2010, during my internship at the University Extension Dean's Office, made me realize how much I enjoy leading people to the understanding of their finances and the results of their business strategies. So, as soon as I finished college, I became a member of the Regional Business Administration Council<sup>1</sup> to validate the recognition of my profession and also to give authenticity to any independent work I did.

## First projects

I spent two months delved into my first consultancy as an independent professional. The owners of an engineering company had an important decision to make, which could culminate in its voluntary dissolution. Knowing the current financial situation would be crucial in this process. An audit of accounts and an examination of tax, financial and accounting documents were the essential starting point. As a result, I presented a final financial report showing how the company was being managed, the composition of its costs, debts and forecasts.

In late 2011, another project emerged, in which the consultancy was focused on improving its financial management and inventory control processes.
