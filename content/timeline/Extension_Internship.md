## The invitation

Since mid-2009, I have been involved in project extensions at the University<sup>1</sup>. Whether working actively as a volunteer or researching my thesis. When I received an invitation to be part of the extension programs department<sup>2</sup>, I was pretty excited and proud of myself. That meant that my dedication was notorious.

A professor specialized in finance became my supervisor to guide me in my main task of advising Solidarity Economy ventures.

## University Incubator Project

I worked with an association of women without income who were learning to be owners of their own business through the solidarity economy methodology. It was a cooperative venture recognized as a pilot project of economic-financial viability for solidarity enterprises, supported by the Government, mayor’s office, and the University. I acted as a facilitating agent between the women and some institutions when dealing with bureaucracy. On the other hand, I could use my knowledge in finance to support them in the management of the business, advising them and giving a full consultancy. The process of foster financial education was so successful that I travelled to the countryside to give talks to local producers and small cooperatives.
