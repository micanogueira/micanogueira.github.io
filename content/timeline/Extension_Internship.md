Since I started my university life and discovered that there was a department to promote actions aimed at the community, I encountered myself many times involved in those extra activities. I was one of the students who held the flag ‘University, Student, and Society’, because I believed in a humanizing formation, in which the student can be led through a technically and ethically way. I officially took part as a volunteer in at least three different projects. Hence, I was invited by the University to intern in one of the projects that I had already started to dedicate my free time to research. I worked with an association of women without income who were learning to be owners of their own business through the solidarity economy methodology. It was a cooperative venture recognized as a pilot project of economic-financial viability for solidarity enterprises, supported by the Government, mayor’s office, and the University. I acted as a facilitating agent between the women and some institutions when dealing with bureaucracy. On the other hand, I could use my knowledge in finance to support them in the management of the business, advising them and giving a full consultancy. The process of foster financial education was so successfull that I traveled to the countryside to give talks to local producers and small cooperatives.
