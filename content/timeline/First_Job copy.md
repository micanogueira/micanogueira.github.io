## "The good son always returns home"

I was invited to work again (once in 2006) on the company's main project, AVRO dx, a complete online English-Portuguese-English Dictionary. This time, temporarily, reviewing the formatting and testing the platform as an end user. In addition, I supported the administrative team with a focus on financial routine and customer service.
