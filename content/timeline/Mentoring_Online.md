### The passion for mentoring awakens

In mid-2019, I was approached by a person who lives in Brazil, asking for guidance in the development of their startup, which was at a very early stage. As I was about to travel to Brazil on vacation in a few weeks, I arranged to meet them in person and learn more about their project. We had some meetings during my stay in Brazil, and I started to mentor them and their partner. I returned to Munich and continued this mentoring for a few months.

In the meantime, other people have reached me, which made me decide to be an empowering agent of entrepreneurship. Since then, I have voluntarily and remotely been mentoring startups and small businesses in Brazil.
