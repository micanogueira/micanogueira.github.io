### The passion for mentoring awakens

In mid-2019, I was approached by a person living in Brazil, asking for guidance in the development of their startup, which was at a very early stage. As I was about to travel to Brazil on vacation in a few weeks, I arranged to meet them in person and learn more about their project. We had some meetings during my stay in Brazil, I met their partners and started to mentor them. I returned to Munich and continued this mentorship for a few months.

In the meantime, other people have reached me, which made me decide to be an empowering agent of entrepreneurship, voluntarily and remotely guiding startups and small businesses in Brazil, fostering their strategies in different areas, from business plans to marketing.
