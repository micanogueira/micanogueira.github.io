## Exploring the accounting field

At the end of my first year of college, while I became the teaching assistant of the Introduction to Accounting discipline of the Financial Management course, I found a great opportunity to explore beyond classes and learn how an accounting office works. So, in addition to teaching, I became an intern at a oil and energy company<sup>1</sup>. For the first time, I worked with an integrated system as well as with the analysis of financial indexes, account reconciliation, and a variety of taxes.
