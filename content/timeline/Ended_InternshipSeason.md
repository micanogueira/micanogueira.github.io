## Closing a cycle

I can say that it was hard to close this cycle, especially due to my deep involvement with at least two social projects while working at the University's Dean of Extension. I really wanted to continue this work for the next semester, and so did my supervisor and the team. However, I had to turn over a new leaf. I embraced the feeling of fulfilment and accepted that I did my best while I could. I recommended a worthy friend to replace me and give as much love and dedication as I did. I had a personal situation to face and move on.

## Started to work at Tutta¹

Working full time during my final year of college was challenging. On the other hand, it was a great chance to consolidate the knowledge acquired so far. I started working in the office of a fashion company where I was responsible for supporting the financial routine of all payments and receipts, as well as for the budget and composition of production costs. In addition, I supported the industrial production team in the management of materials logistics and optimization of the production process through the PPC (Production Planning and Control) methodology, for which I received adequate training to develop the necessary skills.
