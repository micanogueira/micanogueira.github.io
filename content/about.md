Hi, I'm Micaelle 👋🏻  a Brazilian financial accounting specialist living in beautiful Munich, Germany. I'm passionate about leading people and driving business to understand their operations and results. After 12 uninterrupted years of building my career in Brazil, a new era began in my life when I moved to Munich. I've been filling this gap by honing other skills and focusing on integrating into the German way of life and also preparing to grasp opportunities here, on the other side of the Earth.

## And a little bit more about me

A poet since childhood, I have a passion for writing and reading. As a nature lover, biking, hiking and going everywhere I can be surrounded by trees is another passion – one that triggers inspiration and connects it to the soul. Flavours, smells and textures [!!!spoiler alert] reveal my passion for cooking and, consequently, for food. When I'm not in my kitchen, I love to visit restaurants and explore cities and villages to experience their cuisine. I have other passions in life and much more on my bucket list, but I can't extend any more lines here... 🙃 In short, I'm passionate about living.
