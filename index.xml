&lt;p>Studying abroad has been a dream for over a decade! When I finally had the opportunity to live overseas, I set that as my main goal. While still in Brazil, I found TUM&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, the Technical University of Munich, as the place where I wanted to study and build my academic life abroad. Getting admitted after an extensive application process was literally a dream come true!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the way, this website is an outcome of my application for enrollment in the Bachelor in Management &amp;amp; Technology&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> program, as a portfolio and a creative way to show an extension of my technical skills related to Computer Engineering, the field of specialization in technology that I chose in this program.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Documents</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/documents/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 16:41:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/documents/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>I love that feeling of starting something new at the beginning of the year, even if it means restarting something!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In January 2020, I started a German course at a language school&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> and completed the A1 module in about 2 months of intensive classes. However, it had to be stopped due to COVID-19 restrictions. In mid-May, I resumed the learning process using an online platform from an excellent German school&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>. After a few months, I realized that it was not really working. I was progressing very well, passing the exercises without any problem, but I did not feel that the knowledge was taking root. I gave it some time, but that feeling remained. So I contacted a German teacher and arranged the beginning of private lessons in January 2021.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Professional</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/highlights/professional/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:21:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/highlights/professional/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="at-a-glance-achievements-and-highlights-throughout-my-professional-journey">At a glance: achievements and highlights throughout my professional journey&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In mid-2015, I was very committed to learning a certain programming language, R&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, due to my interest in furthering the studies in the statistics that I was studying on my MBA in finance. I decided to study alone, on weekends, the only free time I had. I had started an online course, but soon I realized that I should know the basics of programming first. I was stuck at the beginning of this course and gave up. Nonetheless, the idea of acquiring skills in such a tool that could improve data manipulation and analysis never left my mind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Volunteered for a 36-hour hackathon</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/volunteer_hackillinois/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/volunteer_hackillinois/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hackillinois">HackIllinois&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every year, since 2014, on the last weekend of February, there is a 36-hour university hackathon run by students, the HackIllinois&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>. It is the largest open-source hackathon in the world and brings in approximately 1,000 students from across the United States. An event like this requires a lot of teamwork. In the 2020 edition, I joined the team of volunteers, willing to help out the staff at any level.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Started a German course</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_german/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_german/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="new-year-new-projects">New year, new projects&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I love that feeling of starting something new at the beginning of the year. I was very excited to start learning German at a language school&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> at last. On January 7th, I was completely lost on my first day of school. That first week was challenging. In the next two months, I realized that I was already quite acquainted with the language and enjoying learning it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Travelled abroad to study English</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_london/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_london/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="confidence-is-the-key">Confidence is the key&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I completed the English course in Brazil a month before moving to Europe. I believed that I was ready to travel abroad and communicate fluently. However, it was a shock when I moved and realized that I could barely understand what people were saying. The different accents sounded like another language to me. It took me about 2 months to train my ears and get used to it. I tried to learn German and improve my English at the same time, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. At least, it worked to show me that I needed to focus on one language at a time. So I chose to focus on improving my English, finishing what I had already started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Started to mentor startups and small businesses</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/mentoring_online/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/mentoring_online/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-passion-for-mentoring-awakens">The passion for mentoring awakens&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In mid-2019, I was approached by a person living in Brazil, asking for guidance in the development of their startup, which was at a very early stage. As I was about to travel to Brazil on vacation in a few weeks, I arranged to meet them in person and learn more about their project. We had some meetings during my stay in Brazil, I met their partners and started to mentor them. I returned to Munich and continued this mentorship for a few months.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moved to another continent</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/moved_munich/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/moved_munich/</guid><description>&lt;p>Going abroad was always a dream: living a completely different lifestyle, exploring new experiences, getting used to other cultures and customs, learning a foreign language&amp;hellip; In mid-2016, I decided to include it on my wish list and add a purpose: studying abroad, which since my graduation had been a dream.

&lt;p>A friend of mine who was also a former co-worker invited me to mentor in the &amp;ldquo;financial week&amp;rdquo; of a startup acceleration program&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>. I was very excited to have this opportunity to share knowledge and support the local startup ecosystem. As it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be different, my engagement went beyond that week. I became part of the examining board, judging the various early-stage startups, their businesses and their financial projections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enrolled in an English school</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_english/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_english/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="english-in-brazil">English in Brazil&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In Latin America, Brazilians are the only ones who speak Portuguese. Even though we are surrounded by countries that have Spanish as their mother tongue, we do not have a second official language. It may be the reason why there&amp;rsquo;s no incentive to learn another language. In the second part of elementary education in public schools, English is mandatory, but it does not go beyond the basics. Unfortunately, taking an English course privately is something that does not fit the budget of most Brazilians.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Got an MBA in Finance</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/postgraduate_mba/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/postgraduate_mba/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-opportune-time">The opportune time&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I had been pursuing an MBA since I was about to finish college. However, it only became possible three years later, which I can say was even better due to the professional and personal maturity that I had acquired so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even amid a swirl of things to manage in my &lt;a href="https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/startup_sympla/">current job&lt;/a>, getting an MBA in Finance represented an appropriate personal decision. The skills that I learned and improved perfectly fit the needs I had to fulfil in the scenario the company I was working for was in, especially during its M&amp;amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) processes, which was something that I was leading and doing for the very first time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Started working at Sympla</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/startup_sympla/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/startup_sympla/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="from-the-ground-up">From the ground up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This experience gave me an incredible opportunity to make a difference! I was the Financial Manager and Team Leader of a successful startup, Sympla&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, an online platform for sale and management of tickets and registration for events. I worked there for four years, since the embryonic stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first time I met Rodrigo Cartacho, the CEO, was special. It was on this memorable occasion that I, full of enthusiasm, decided to dive right into the challenge of starting four departments from scratch. Rodrigo conducted one of the stages of the interview process, which took place on the balcony because, at that time, there was no meeting room. This small and simple detail became a milestone, as it represents how long the travelled road was when the starting point for me was a room with a meeting room under construction and four newly hired employees – the very first ones – and the destination was almost the entire building occupied and more than 200 employees working on. More than that, we have transformed a start-up into the company with the largest number of events for sale in Brazil. It meant a lot of work and concerted effort by the entire team, and pride and joy, consequently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Got the first job as a Manager</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/manager_first/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/manager_first/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="audit-and-consultancy-phase">Audit and consultancy phase&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What was supposed to be only an audit led me to my first job as a financial manager. I was approached by one of the partners to do an independent audit of their company&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, including assets and debts since its inception. Within a month, the CEO asked for a blueprint of what would be an ideal finance department.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the audit, I built the finance department, its processes and routine from scratch; created the job description, selected and hired a person to do the basics tasks – an assistant – and get the department started. At the end of the audit and consultancy, the CEO, who longed for a more organized company, with well-defined planning and procedures, invited me to work alongside him to restructure it. So, I assumed the role of Manager of the finance, administrative and human resources departments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Founded my own business</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/own_business/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/own_business/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="quatrenhum-events">Quatrenhum Events&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I identified a pain point in the operation of promotional marketing companies as a market opportunity while freelancing for them. I participated in all stages of the operation in two or three companies and realized that they could all do better. So, I decided to solve this pain point by creating a solution that was a scalable business. As this market was not my area of expertise, I invited a friend to fill this gap and be my business partner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alternated a new job with consulting activity</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/alternated_jobs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/alternated_jobs/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="spinning-plates">Spinning plates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I set high expectations for my first job after college, which I agreed to start from scratch on an unusual program at a car dealership&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>. This program assigned me to do elementary tasks as a way to acquaint myself with all subdivisions in the finance department. That way, I would know all the processes, their strengths and weaknesses, which would enable me to reach a leadership position in a short period of time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Got the first projects as an Independent Consultant</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/first_consultancies/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/first_consultancies/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="laying-the-groundwork">Laying the groundwork&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My experience as a financial advisor in 2010, during my internship at the University Extension Dean&amp;rsquo;s Office, made me realize how much I enjoy leading people to the understanding of their finances and the results of their business strategies. So, as soon as I finished college, I became a member of the Regional Business Administration Council&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> to validate the recognition of my profession and also to give authenticity to any independent work I did.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Graduated with Honour</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/graduated_honour/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/graduated_honour/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="mission-accomplished">Mission accomplished&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As is customary in Brazil, the person who graduates with the highest overall grade throughout the undergraduate program is announced at the Graduation Ceremony and honoured with a medal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was wearing a graduation gown and, along with my classmates, attending the graduation ceremony when a professor came to announce the student with the best grades in our class. My friends were already staring at me, and my family was saying my name a few seconds before the professor named it. In that fraction of time, I just took a deep breath and remembered how much I dedicated myself to be the first person in my family to graduate from a University; how hard I worked to be there; how many nights studying to recover the time that I spent in an office, working, while other students could only focus on studying; how proud I was of myself&amp;hellip; and then, my name was called! Applause and shouting were the soundtracks that pushed me to the stage to be honoured. In that night, I was awarded a Golden Medal of Honour for outstanding performance throughout the Financial Management program at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Completed the internship season</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/ended_internshipseason/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/ended_internshipseason/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="closing-a-cycle">Closing a cycle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I can say that it was hard to close this cycle, especially due to my deep involvement with at least two social projects while working at the University&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Extension. I really wanted to continue this work for the next semester, and so did my supervisor and the team. However, I had to turn over a new leaf. I embraced the feeling of fulfilment and accepted that I did my best while I could. I recommended a worthy friend to replace me and give as much love and dedication as I did. I had a personal situation to face and move on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Invited to be part of the University Extension Program team</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/extension_internship/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/extension_internship/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-invitation">The invitation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since mid-2009, I have been involved in project extensions at the University&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, either working actively as a volunteer or researching my thesis. When I received an invitation to be part of the extension programs department&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>, I was pretty excited and proud of myself. That meant that my dedication was notorious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A professor specialized in finance became my supervisor to guide me in my main task of advising solidarity economy ventures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Became coordinator of a University Extension Program</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/coordinator_extension/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/coordinator_extension/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="engagement">Engagement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As soon as my second year of college&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> started, I tried to remain engaged in extracurricular activities. I was invited by the same professor with whom I worked in the &lt;a href="https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/engaged_extension/">previous extension program&lt;/a> to be the coordinator of a new extension program he had submitted to the University. I volunteered to lead the &amp;ldquo;Student - University - Society Integration Program&amp;rdquo; project, which aimed to advocate for education and strengthen the university&amp;rsquo;s mission by providing training to students and encouraging their interchange with teachers, staff, classmates, and community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Started a financial internship</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/financial_internship/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/financial_internship/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="from-classes-to-office-hands-on-experience">From classes to office: hands-on experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since I became the teaching assistant of the Financial Mathematics discipline of the Financial Management program, I wanted to bring vivid experiences into the classroom. Therefore, I also became an intern at an engineering company&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My interest in learning to apply those maths in a real environment drove me to assume so many responsibilities that I ended up replacing my supervisor for a month. For the first time, I could operate the entire financial routine of a company, including cash flow control and bank negotiations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Started teaching a new discipline</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/new_discipline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/new_discipline/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="new-semester-more-knowledge-to-share">New semester, more knowledge to share&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I found great joy in teaching other classes and showing them different ways to learn and improve their skills. For that reason, at the beginning of my second year of college&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, I decided to continue being a teaching assistant but in a new discipline. Therefore, I became the teaching assistant of the Financial Mathematics discipline of the Financial Management program.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At the end of my first year of college, while I became the teaching assistant of the Introduction to Accounting discipline of the Financial Management program, I found a great opportunity to explore beyond classes and learn how an accounting office works. So, in addition to teaching, I became an intern at a company&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> that provides survey services to the mining, gas and oil, and groundwater industries. For the first time, I worked with an integrated system as well as with the analysis of financial indexes, account reconciliation, and a variety of taxes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Found a passion for teaching</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/passion_teaching/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/passion_teaching/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-passion">The passion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In fact, that passion has always been there, hidden in my guts. When I was only six to seven years old, in my first year of school, I had my first experience teaching. I supported the class teacher by helping my peers learn to read. I was timid at that time, but sitting next to someone else and teaching reading and writing was very natural. In the following years of elementary school, I created lessons and printed them out for the class to do as homework. It was like I was a very young teaching assistant.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Engaged in University Extension Programs</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/engaged_extension/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/engaged_extension/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="roots">Roots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Throughout my school life, I was involved in extracurricular activities such as choir, student council, newspaper, theatre, and dance. I used to extend my hours at school, supporting teachers and diverse staff members. I had often been a class representative. Sometimes, a commencement speaker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I entered college&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>, it was no different. In the first year, I already found myself involved in an extracurricular activity: extension programs. I volunteered to support the &amp;ldquo;Census and Citizenship&amp;rdquo; project, which aimed to diagnose the community&amp;rsquo;s socio-economic situation in order to highlight and prioritize their needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Returned to work at the company where got the first job</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/back_origins/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/back_origins/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="heading">&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;The good son always returns home&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was invited to work again (once in 2006) on the company&amp;rsquo;s&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> main project, AVRO dx, an unabridged online English-Portuguese-English Dictionary. This time, temporarily, reviewing the formatting and testing the platform as an end-user. Besides, I supported the administrative team with a focus on financial routine and customer service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a QA tester came very naturally to me, although I had never played that role before. Working with the IT team, I contributed to the platform usage by reporting issues and requesting features, which turned into great improvements. Consequently, an open communication channel emerged between IT and other co-workers who also wanted to contribute.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Won a scholarship to College</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/won_scholarship2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/won_scholarship2/</guid><description>&lt;p>I received a high score in the national entrance exam (known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio">ENEM&lt;/a> in Brazil), which made me eligible to win a scholarship to college.

&lt;p>Since the beginning of my second year of high school, while working in a bank in parallel, my dream was to study economics. I aimed at the Federal University, which offered a recognizable program in economics. This dream lasted the two years I had to finish high school. During a vocational test and visit to the Federal University, I discovered that the classes would be in the morning and afternoon. This important information shattered my dream because working was a matter of necessity for me. I had to work to study, to pay for basic expenses such as academic books, transportation and food. I couldn’t afford to study on a shift other than at night.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Started an internship at a Federal Bank</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/internship_bank/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/internship_bank/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="inspiration-moves-us-brightly">Inspiration moves us brightly!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I met Andrea for the first time in my interview, when she pointed to the desk and said: “You will work there if you pass this process”. I left the interview with a genuine smile on my face. I felt with all my heart that this internship vacancy would be mine. That is the most vivid and shiny memory I have of this experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Andrea was my supervisor and also the manager of the sector where I worked at the bank&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup>. More than that, she was my first female reference and inspiration for leadership. I admired so much the way she treated people equally, clients and coworkers, at any level, that I decided to follow her.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Won a scholarship</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/won_scholarship/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/won_scholarship/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="contextualizing">Contextualizing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It all started when I heard the news that some private schools in my hometown were offering scholarships to high school students who couldn’t afford it. That caught my attention immediately. Admission to universities in Brazil requires students to sit a very competitive entrance exam known as &lt;em>vestibular&lt;/em>. Private high school students have a great advantage due to the high-quality education they receive. Besides, they can afford extra classes or preparatory courses for the entrance exam. At that time, all my studies had been completed in public school. Furthermore, financing a preparatory course was out of the question. The news really put me back on track to pursue higher education.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Got the first job</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/first_job/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/first_job/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="it-started-even-before-it-started">It started even before it started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I was fifteen years old, in late 2005, I came across an offer to learn to type. I did not have a computer at the time, but I was eager to learn, starting with the basics. Then, the founder of AVRO&lt;sup>1&lt;/sup> — a family’s friend — offered to teach it to me for an hour a day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within a few months, I was using the acquired abilities to help him in his ambitious project, AVRO dx, an unabridged online English-Portuguese-English Dictionary. I was informally organizing and formatting a copy of the database as a way to practice typing. When I realized, I was also reporting some errors and doing this job so quickly that he invited me to officially contribute to the project and work in the company as an assistant in administrative routines.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
