In January 2020, I started a German course at a language school1 and completed the A1 module in about 2 months of intensive classes. However, it had to be stopped due to COVID-19 restrictions. In mid-May, I resumed the learning process using an online platform from an excellent German school2.</description></item><item><title>Professional</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/highlights/professional/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:21:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/highlights/professional/</guid><description>At a glance: achievements and highlights throughout my professional journey ¬† Head of Finance at Sympla¬†-¬†4 yrs Had an incredible opportunity to build a startup from the ground up¬†

Throughout my career, I have worked several times alongside the IT team, and the most I did was to design mock-ups of tools and features. I can say that I have always been close enough to learn to code. In fact, I always wanted to know how to code to be independent, to build my own tools and features, to meet my needs more quickly and autonomously.</description></item><item><title>Volunteered for a 36-hour hackathon</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/volunteer_hackillinois/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/volunteer_hackillinois/</guid><description>HackIllinois Every year, since 2014, on the last weekend of February, there is a 36-hour university hackathon run by students, the HackIllinois1. It is the largest open-source hackathon in the world and brings in approximately 1,000 students from across the United States. An event like this requires a lot of teamwork. In the 2020 edition, I joined the team of volunteers, willing to help out the staff at any level.</description></item><item><title>Started a German course</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_german/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/timeline/studying_german/</guid><description>New year, new projects I love that feeling of starting something new at the beginning of the year. I was very excited to start learning German at a language school1 at last. On January 7th, I was completely lost on my first day of school. That first week was challenging. In the next two months, I realized that I was already quite acquainted with the language and enjoying learning it.</description></item></channel></rss>
