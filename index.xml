When I finally had the opportunity to live overseas, I set that as my main goal. While still in Brazil, I found TUM1, the Technical University of Munich, as the place where I wanted to study and build my academic life abroad. Getting admitted after an extensive application process was literally a dream come true!
By the way, this website is an outcome of my application for enrollment in the Bachelor in Management &amp;amp; Technology2 program, as a portfolio and a creative way to show an extension of my technical skills related to Computer Engineering, the field of specialization in technology that I chose in this program.</description></item><item><title>Documents</title><link>https://micanogueira.github.io/documents/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 16:41:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://micanogueira.github.io/documents/</guid><description>Click here to access my Curriculum Vitae

In January 2020, I started a German course at a language school1 and completed the A1 module in about 2 months of intensive classes. However, it had to be stopped due to COVID-19 restrictions.
